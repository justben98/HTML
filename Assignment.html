        <div>Taking care of a woman is a challenging job.
             This is especially true if you are her boyfriend and trying to figure out what she wants.
             Man and woman are a different species with different needs.
             How can we hope to care for each other in the way that we would like to?
             The truth is that it is impossible.
             Misunderstandings are inevitable.
             You cannot avoid stepping on each other's toes.
             The only thing you can do is to be as considerate as possible
             and apologize when you have wronged her.
