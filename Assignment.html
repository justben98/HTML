             <p align="center">
                Taking care of a woman is a challenging job.<br>
                <b>This is especially true if you are her boyfriend 
                and trying to figure out what she wants.</b><br>
                <i>Man and woman are a different species with different needs.</i><br>
                How can we hope to care for each other in the way that we would like to?<br>
                The truth is that it is impossible.<br>
                Misunderstandings are inevitable.<br>
                You cannot avoid stepping on each other's toes.<br>
                The only thing you can do is to be as considerate as possible<br>
                and apologize when you have wronged her.
