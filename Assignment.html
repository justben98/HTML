                Taking care of a woman is a challenging job.</br>
                <b>This is especially true if you are her boyfriend 
                and trying to figure out what she wants.</b></br>
                <i>Man and woman are a different species with different needs.</i></hr>
                <hr>How can we hope to care for each other in the way that we would like to?</br>
                The truth is that it is impossible.</br>
                Misunderstandings are inevitable.</hr>
                <hr align="right">You cannot avoid stepping on each other's toes.</br>
                The only thing you can do is to be as considerate as possible</br>
                and apologize when you have wronged her.
